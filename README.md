# Sales-Insights-Data-Analysis-Project

### Project Background

Atliq hardware is a company which supplies computer hardware and peripherals to many of the clients (different stores). Atliq has its headquarters and many other branches and the challenge that the sales director faces is gathering insights on how the other branches are functioning. Currently, he/she would gather insight details by calling their regional managers but due to the lack of accuracy, completeness and false information they fail to get the much accurate, completed factful insights regarding the business. Therefore, the requirement of the sales director is to get simple, understandable, digestible insights rather than numbers but through a visualization where they could glance and get which information are accurate and complete to make necessary adjustments in Atliq.
